Motivation: Seeking the best and cheapest way to diagnose individuals with COVID-19 infections or suspects. Or finding new viral and bacterial pneumonia (MERS, SARS, and ARDS). In Egypt, polymerise chain reaction (PCR) test takes around 48 hours to get the result, and the result isn’t always accurate and costs a lot of money in the range of 1000 – 2000, so many people can't afford it. Also, these tests aren't available in many governments so people could die for not having these tests, Also, due to the huge amount of infected people, there's a lack of medicine in the local pharmacies. Goals: Due to the lack of medicine, wrong clinical diagnosis by some doctors, and the enormous amount of money that the country spends on tests and medications, we decided to create a web application that uses Deep Learning and Artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze " CT chest - Chest X-ray " for suspected individuals and getting the results immediately and efficiently.
